# Price Comparison Feature

## Overview

The Officeworks Stock Checker bot now includes a comprehensive price comparison feature that allows users to compare prices across multiple Australian retailers. This feature helps users identify potential price matching opportunities and find the best deals.

## Supported Retailers

The price comparison system currently supports the following retailers:

- **JB Hi-Fi** - Electronics and entertainment
- **Harvey Norman** - Electronics and appliances  
- **Amazon AU** - Wide range of products
- **Officeworks** - Office supplies and electronics

*Note: Big W and Kmart were removed due to prevalence of marketplace sellers affecting price accuracy.*

## How It Works

### 1. Firecrawl Integration

The system uses Firecrawl to extract product data from retailer websites. Firecrawl provides:
- **Extract Feature**: Structured data extraction using LLMs and schemas
- JavaScript rendering for dynamic content
- Clean markdown and HTML extraction as fallback
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Content filtering for main product information

### 2. Price Extraction

For each retailer, the system:
- **Primary**: Uses Firecrawl Extract with structured schemas for precise data
- **Fallback**: Traditional markdown/HTML parsing if Extract fails  
- Searches using cleaned product names
- Extracts product titles, prices, and availability
- Matches products based on enhanced similarity scores
- Identifies the best matching products

### 3. Price Match Detection

The system analyzes prices to identify:
- Products cheaper than Officeworks
- Potential price match opportunities
- Savings amounts and percentages
- Products within a reasonable price range

## Commands

### /check with Price Comparison

Enhanced the existing `/check` command with an optional price comparison parameter:

```
/check product_code:ipdmw128g compare_prices:True
```

**Parameters:**
- `product_code` - The Officeworks product code to check
- `compare_prices` - Boolean flag to enable price comparison (default: False)

**Behavior:**
1. Checks the current Officeworks price
2. If `compare_prices` is True, searches other retailers
3. Shows a comparison embed with potential savings
4. Highlights price match opportunities

### /compare - Standalone Price Comparison

New command for comparing prices without tracking:

```
/compare search_query:"iPad Mini 128GB"
/compare search_query:ipdmw128g officeworks_price:899.00
```

**Parameters:**
- `search_query` - Product name, description, or Officeworks product code
- `officeworks_price` - Optional Officeworks price for comparison

**Behavior:**
1. If no Officeworks price provided, tries to extract from product code
2. Searches all configured retailers
3. Shows comprehensive price comparison
4. Provides search suggestions if no results found

## Price Match Opportunities

The system identifies potential price match scenarios by:

### Eligibility Criteria
- Product found at competing retailer
- Competitor price is lower than Officeworks price
- Price difference is at least $0.01
- Product similarity score meets threshold

### Price Match Alerts
When price match opportunities are found, the bot displays:
- üéØ Price match eligible indicator
- Exact savings amount
- Retailer name and price
- Instructions for price matching

### Example Output
```

## Configuration

### Retailer Configuration

Each retailer is configured with:

```python
RetailerConfig(
    name="JB Hi-Fi",
    base_url="https://www.jbhifi.com.au",
    search_url="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/search?query={query}",
    price_selectors=['.price-current', '.price .price-value'],
    title_selectors=['.product-title', '.product-name'],
    link_selectors=['.product-item a'],
    price_match_threshold=0.95
)
```

### Search Optimization

Product names are cleaned for better search results:
- Remove common stop words
- Remove brand-specific terms
- Limit to relevant keywords
- Handle special characters

### Rate Limiting

The system implements rate limiting:
- 2-second delay between retailer searches
- 1-second delay between individual requests
- Maximum 4-5 retailers per search
- Error handling for failed requests

## Setup and Configuration

### Firecrawl Setup

1. **Install Firecrawl MCP** (if using Cursor environment):
   ```bash
   # Firecrawl MCP should be available in Cursor
   ```

2. **Alternative: Direct API Integration**:
   ```bash
   pip install firecrawl-py
   ```
   
   Then configure API key in environment:
   ```
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Bot Configuration

The price comparison is automatically initialized when the bot starts:

```python
# In bot.py
from price_comparison import price_comparison
from firecrawl_integration import firecrawl_integration

# Configure price comparison with Firecrawl
price_comparison.firecrawl_client = firecrawl_integration
```

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

### Firecrawl Unavailable
- Falls back to informational message
- Suggests configuration steps
- Continues with Officeworks price check

### Retailer Search Failures
- Skips failed retailers
- Continues with successful ones
- Logs errors for debugging

### No Results Found
- Provides search suggestions
- Shows alternative search terms
- Maintains user-friendly messaging

### Rate Limiting
- Implements delays between requests
- Handles 429 responses gracefully
- Limits concurrent searches

## Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Scraping Dependencies**: Relies on retailer website structure
2. **Product Matching**: May not find exact matches for all products
3. **Price Accuracy**: Prices may not reflect current promotions
4. **Regional Availability**: Limited to Australian retailers

### Future Enhancements
1. **API Integrations**: Direct retailer API connections where available
2. **Machine Learning**: Improved product matching algorithms
3. **More Retailers**: Expand to additional Australian retailers
4. **Price History**: Track competitor price changes over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Results Found**
   - Try shorter, more generic search terms
   - Check spelling and product names
   - Use brand/model numbers instead of full names

2. **Slow Response Times**
   - Normal for first-time searches
   - Subsequent searches may be faster
   - Rate limiting ensures reliability

3. **Firecrawl Errors**
   - Check Firecrawl configuration
   - Verify API keys if using direct integration
   - Check network connectivity

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by checking bot console output for:
- `[Firecrawl] Scraping URL: ...`
- `Price comparison error: ...`
- `Error searching {retailer}: ...`

## Privacy and Ethics

### Data Handling
- No personal data stored from retailer searches
- Product information temporarily cached during comparison
- Respects retailer robots.txt and rate limits

### Responsible Scraping
- Implements appropriate delays
- Uses Firecrawl's ethical scraping practices
- Focuses on publicly available product information
- Respects website terms of service

## Support

For issues with the price comparison feature:

1. Check the bot's status with `/status`
2. Try simpler search terms
3. Verify Firecrawl configuration
4. Check bot logs for error messages
5. Report persistent issues to the bot administrator
